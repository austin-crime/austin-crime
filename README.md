### Project Goals

- Create a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a crime is solved/closed in Austin.

### Problem Statement

- What factors contribute to whether or not a crime is solved/closed in the city of Austin?

### Project Description

- This project will dive into crime data from the city of Austin for the years 2018 through 2021. 
- Having a deeper understanding of the crime in Austin will allow for improved public safety 
outcomes. 
- This project will cover key indicators for successfully closing a case, the most frequent 
types of crimes, Austin city district crime rate, and the seasonality of crimes. 
- Our goal is that this project will guide the allocation of resources toward improving public 
safety. Letâ€™s keep Austin weird! And safe.

### Initial Questions

- We predict that there is a relationship between the type of crime and clearance status.
- We predict there is a relationship between city council district and clearance status.
- We predict that there is a relationship between higher seasonal levels of crime and clearance status.
- We predict that the difference in time between when an incident occurred and when it was reported relates to the clearance status of the case.

## IV. Outline of Project Plan

The overall process followed in this project is as follows:

###  Plan  -->  Acquire   --> Prepare  --> Explore  --> Model  --> Deliver

### Data Acquisition

<details><summary><i>Click to expand</i></summary>


**Acquisition Files:**


**Steps Taken:**

- The data set was gathered from publicly available data provided by the Austin Police 
Department on data.austintexas.gov.
- We created a function to automate gathering the data from the provided API and caching it 
locally as a CSV file. 
- Our initial data set included 500,000 rows and 31 columns. 
- For ease of use and relevancy, we decided to limit our data to crimes reported between the 
years 2018 and 2021. 
- After removing data outside this time frame, we were left with 401,955 rows.

### Data Preparation

<details><summary><i>Click to expand</i></summary>git

**Preparation Files:**


**Steps Taken:**

- After investigating columns with missing values, we decided to drop 15 columns entirely that we deemed to be unuseful or redundant. 
- Next, we made decisions on how to handle the missing values in our remaining 16 columns. 
- For 7 columns, including clearance_status, clearance_date, zip_code, sector, district, latitude, and longitude, we decided that we could not reasonably impute nulls with a value and dropped all missing rows. 
- We had 753 missing values for location_type values which we decided to add to the Other / Unknown value. 
- We had 1438 missing values for council_district which we decided to impute as the most common district.
